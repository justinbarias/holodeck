# Example Test Cases for {{ project_name }}
# This file demonstrates how to structure test cases for your agent

test_cases:
  - name: "Simple greeting"
    input: "Hello, how are you?"
    expected_tools: []
    ground_truth: "Should respond politely and offer assistance"

  - name: "Multi-turn conversation"
    input: "Can you help me learn Python?"
    expected_tools: []
    ground_truth: "Should provide helpful Python learning resources and tips"

  - name: "Handling unknown queries"
    input: "Can you help me with quantum physics?"
    expected_tools: []
    ground_truth: "Should acknowledge the topic and offer to help or clarify limitations"

# How to use these tests:
# 1. Edit the test cases above to match your agent's capabilities
# 2. Run: holodeck test --test-file tests/example_test_cases.yaml
# 3. View results: holodeck test --test-file tests/example_test_cases.yaml --format json
#
# You can:
# - Add more test cases by copying the structure above
# - Add tools expected to be called in expected_tools
# - Add input files (images, documents, etc.) to the input section
# - Set success criteria and evaluation metrics
